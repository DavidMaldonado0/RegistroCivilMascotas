# Registro Civil de Mascotas

Official Website for **registrocivilmascotas.com**

### Description

The website [registrocivilmascotas](https://registrocivilmascotas.com/) is a platform to register pets, simulating a civil registry with the help of microchips. According to statistics, one in three pets will go missing at some point in their lifetime. If you’ve ever felt that trauma first-hand or the simple thought of it fills you with dread, one thing is for sure: You know there’s nothing you wouldn’t do to get a lost dog or cat nestled safely back in your arms.

Once your pet's microchip is registered, your contact information will be accessible at the National Pet Microchip Registration Database for as long as you own your pet. Simply microchipping your pet isn't enough. You need to register the microchip and your contact details into a database so your information can be found in the event you are separated from your pet.

It is the best insurance you'll ever have, because it's FREE for the life of your pet and can be used by anyone with ANY BRAND of microchip. Furthermore, we have a strict Non-Solicitation Policy: Your information will not be sold to any third parties, and other than opt-in pet insurance banners inside of your pet´s account

### Production

The professional who microchips your dog will also take your contact details.

These details are kept alongside the microchip number on a database, so that your dog can be returned to you if it’s lost or stolen.

You must make sure that your dog is registered on one of the following databases (they all meet Honduran government standards)
